# 🎯 Quick Start Guide - Wellness Reminders & Diet Plans

## ✅ What's Been Fixed & Added

### 🐛 **FIXED: "No Scheduled Meals" Error**

**Now:** The app automatically creates default meals (Breakfast at 8:00, Lunch at 13:00, Dinner at 19:00) if the plan has no meals, and allows you to customize them!

### 🆕 **NEW: Meal Management**
You can now:
- ✅ Add custom meals with specific names and times
- ✅ Edit meal names and times
- ✅ Delete unwanted meals
- ✅ Schedule reminders for each meal

### 🆕 **NEW: Wellness Reminders Page**
Complete reminder system for:
- 💧 **Water Intake** - Stay hydrated throughout the day

## 💾 Data Persistence

### What Gets Saved
✅ **Diet plans with meals** - Saved to browser localStorage
✅ **Meal schedules** - Persisted with diet plan
✅ **Plan edits** - Automatically saved

### What Doesn't Persist (by design)
⚠️ **Active reminders** - Reset on page reload
⚠️ **Reminder preferences** - Need to be reset each session

**Why?** Browser notifications are temporary by design. For production use, consider:
- Backend API for reminder storage
- Service worker for persistent notifications
- User authentication for cross-device sync
